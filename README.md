# 📊 PhonePe Pulse Data Analysis & Machine Learning Project

This project leverages PhonePe's publicly available Pulse data to uncover business insights, perform exploratory data analysis, and build machine learning models for use cases like customer segmentation, fraud detection, trend forecasting, and state-wise performance benchmarking.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- ✅ Converted raw JSON data from GitHub into structured CSV format (9 datasets across Aggregated, Map, and Top categories).
- 🧼 Performed comprehensive data cleaning, wrangling, and transformation using Python (Pandas, NumPy).
- 📈 Created visualisations to understand transaction trends, user growth, brand penetration, and regional usage.
- 🔬 Performed Hypothesis Testing using ANOVA and Pearson Correlation to validate assumptions.
- 🤖 Built ML Models for:
  - **Customer Segmentation** (KMeans Clustering)
  - **Fraud Detection** (Z-Score, Isolation Forest)
  - **Performance Classification** (Random Forest Classifier)
  - **Time Series Trend Analysis** (Prophet, Line Graphs)
- 📌 Included feature importance interpretation and model explainability for actionable business insights.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models

| Use Case                | Datasets Used               | ML Method             |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|
| Customer Segmentation   | aggregated_user, top_user   | KMeans Clustering      |
| Fraud Detection         | aggregated_transaction      | Z-Score, IsolationForest |
| State Classification    | aggregated_transaction      | Random Forest Classifier |

## 📈 Performance Summary

- **Random Forest Classifier Accuracy:** ~88%
- **Improved F1-Score for Medium class after tuning**
- **Cluster Profiles:** Clear separation of user behaviour across states
- **Hypothesis Testing Results:** All p-values < 0.05 showed statistically significant insights
